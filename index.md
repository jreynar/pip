## Personal Improvement Project, Series 1
Looking to be challenged and to grow in 2022 or to encourage a friend or family to push their boundaries? In time for New Year’s eve, we’ve created a collection of NFT goals that make great resolutions. 

Each item in the collection of 100 lists 5 goals. Some are relatively easy to achieve for most people (like going for a daily walk for a week). Others are harder (trying veganism for a month). A few – those that are truly difficult, time-consuming and elusive – are unicorns in the collection (such as winning an Olympic medal). The easiest are set in black text, medium are red, harder are green and the hardest and rarest are blue.

We encourage you to share your experience with family, friends and the online world by tagging your posts with #pipnft1.

Thanks to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) for inspiring a couple non-arts to create text-only NFTs.
