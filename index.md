## Personal Improvement Project, Series 1
Looking to be challenged and to grow in 2022 or to encourage a friend or family member to push their boundaries? We’ve created The Personal Improvement Project, the first NFT collection of New Year’s resolutions.

Each NFT lists 5 goals. Some are relatively easy to achieve (like going for a daily walk). Others are harder (going vegan). A few – the truly difficult, time-consuming and elusive – are unicorns in the collection (such as winning an Olympic medal). The easiest are in black text, medium are red, hard are green, and the most difficult are blue.

The first series has only 100 NFTs and each is a unique list never to be minted again. Buy, sell, or trade to own the resolutions you want. These NFTs are membership tokens in a community that values learning and growing. We hope the community owns and extends the NFTs in new, unanticipated, and rewarding ways!

We encourage you to share your experience with family, friends and the online community by tagging your posts with #pipnft1


Thanks to [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) for inspiring a couple non-arts to create text-only NFTs.
